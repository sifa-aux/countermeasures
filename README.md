# Auxiliary Material

This repository contains code that was used for performance benchmarks, as well as formal verification of masked SIFA protected implementations of the Keccak Sbox. You can find the corresponding paper [here](https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/536.pdf).

* **keccak200-avr8**: This code can be used to perform a direct performance comparison between masked implementations of `Keccak-f[200]`, with and without SIFA protection.

* **maskverif-toffoli-chi5**: This code can be used to formally verify the correctess of the masking of the proposed SIFA protected varaints of the Keccak Sbox.
